# 20 React Portfolio
 React Portfolio can showcase a developer's skills and experience, and can be customized and updated easily due to React's component-based architecture. React allows developers to efficiently create and manage the various sections and components of a portfolio website, such as the header, navigation, content sections, and footer, among others.

## Description
This portfolio showcases the skills I've acquired through the UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and will be updated with new techonologies and products for potential employers. The portfolio was built with the React framework.
